  Hello, I am Mengxin Pan. In Jan 2025, I will join the Department of Geography at Simon Fraser University as a **tenure-track assistant professor** and build up the **"Climate and Weather Extremes Lab"**. I am a postdoctoral associate in the Division of Earth and Climate Science, Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University. Before that, I got my Ph.D. from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2021) and Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Southeast University (2016).
  I am seeking Master‚Äôs and Ph.D. students to join my group in **Fall 2025** or **Spring/Fall 2026**. Both Master‚Äôs and PhD students have comprehensive funding support, covering tuition and living expenses in Vancouver, Canada.

## Research

My research combines advanced data mining techniques with climate science to address real-world problems, with two interconnected objectives. First, advancing the physical understanding of climate and weather extremes, with specific interests in the mechanism of Atmospheric Rivers and their changes under global warming. Second, bridging the physical and social dimensions in facing climate change challenges. I am leading interdisciplinary research connecting Climate Dynamics with Global Health and Civil Engineering. For example, involving tropical ocean variability in the vector-borne disease prediction in Latin America and assessing the resilience of global bridges under ongoing global warming.

### As a Jekyll theme

1. Add `gem "alembic-jekyll-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies
3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file

### As a Boilerplate / Fork

_(deprecated, not recommended)_

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
