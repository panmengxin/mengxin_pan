        <p>I will join the Department of Geography at Simon Fraser University as a <strong>tenure-track assistant professor</strong> in Jan 2025. I am a postdoctoral associate in the Division of Earth and Climate Science, Nicholas School of the Environment at <strong>Duke University</strong>. Before that, I got my Ph.D. from <strong>the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</strong> (2021) and Bachelor's degree from <strong>Southeast University</strong> (2016).</p>

  I am seeking Master’s and Ph.D. students to join my **"Climate and Weather Extremes Lab"** in **Fall 2025** or **Spring/Fall 2026**. Both Master’s and PhD students have comprehensive funding support, covering tuition and living expenses in Vancouver, Canada.

## Research & Publications

My research combines advanced data mining techniques with climate science to address real-world problems, with two interconnected objectives. First, **advancing the physical understanding of climate and weather extremes**, with specific interests in the mechanism of **Atmospheric Rivers** and their changes in a warming climate. Second, **bridging the physical and social dimensions in facing climate change challenges**. I am leading interdisciplinary research connecting Climate Dynamics with **Global Health** and **Civil Engineering** (e.g., involving tropical ocean variability in the vector-borne disease prediction in Latin America and assessing the resilience of global bridges under the ongoing global warming).


## Fully funded Master's and PhD opportunities

I am seeking Master’s and Ph.D. students to join my **"Climate and Weather Extremes Lab"** in **Fall 2025** or **Spring/Fall 2026**. Both Master’s and PhD students have comprehensive funding support, covering tuition and living expenses in Vancouver, Canada.

The research theme is applied data science in climate science. Students from all climate science and data science backgrounds are welcome, including climate dynamics, atmospheric science, oceanography, physics, or related disciplines. Students from diverse backgrounds who are interested in interdisciplinary research are also welcome, including but not limited in statistics, global health, social science, and civil engineering. 

## Qualifications:
- Bachelor's degree (for Master's applicants) or Master's degree (for Ph.D. applicants); 
- Strong interests in applied data science in climate science (Programming and data analysis proficiency is prefered);
- Strong academic performance;
- Demonstrated self-motivation, independence, and critical thinking ability;


## How to Apply
- Please send your CV, personal/research statement, and academic transcripts to Dr. Mengxin Pan (mengxin.pan@duke.edu).
- Prefer to admit students with prior connections, so early inquiries are strongly encouraged.
- English proficiency scores or publications are not required for initial application.
- The official application deadline for Fall 2026 is **Jan 2025**, so please email me as soon as possible first.
